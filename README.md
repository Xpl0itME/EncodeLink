# URL Encoder and Decoder

A good URL decoder and encoder tool for all users. Unlike other encoders, this tool decodes and encodes URLs **client-side**, so your data is 100% safe and never sent to any server.

## Features

- **URL Encoding**: Encodes the input URL or text into a valid URL format.
- **URL Decoding**: Decodes the encoded URL or text back to its original form.
- **Client-Side Processing**: All encoding and decoding are done on the client-side, ensuring that your data remains private.
- **Theme Toggling**: Switch between light and dark themes for a better user experience.
- **Copy Output**: Copy the output text to the clipboard with a single click.
- **Clear Fields**: Clear both input and output fields with one click.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the application, including light and dark themes.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the encoding/decoding logic, clipboard functionality, and theme switching.

## How to Use

3. **Toggle Themes**: Click the "Toggle Theme" button to switch between light and dark themes.
4. **Copy the Output**: Once you have an encoded or decoded URL, click the "Copy Output" button to copy it to your clipboard.
